### **2. Facebook Outreach Templates**

#### **Template 1: Initial Contact**
```
Hi [Name],

I saw your property listing on [Facebook Group/Marketplace]. 
I run a real estate platform specifically for Malawi properties 
and diaspora buyers.

Would you be interested in having your property listed on my 
platform? It's completely free and will help you reach more 
potential buyers, especially those in South Africa, UK, and USA.

I can create the listing for you - just need:
- Property details (already have from your post)
- A few photos
- Your contact info

Let me know if you're interested!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

#### **Template 2: Follow-Up (If No Response)**
```
Hi [Name],

Just following up on my previous message about listing your 
property on my platform.

The listing is completely free and takes just 5 minutes. 
It could help you reach more serious buyers.

Would you like me to proceed?

Thanks!
```

#### **Template 3: After Listing**
```
Hi [Name],

Great news! I've listed your property on my platform:
[Link to property]

The listing is now live and visible to all visitors, 
including diaspora buyers from SA, UK, and USA.

I'll notify you if anyone makes an inquiry through the platform.

Thanks for letting me list it!

[Your Name]
```
