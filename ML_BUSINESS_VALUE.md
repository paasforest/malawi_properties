## 💰 **1. Price Prediction Model**
### What It Does:
Predicts property prices based on features (district, size, type, etc.)

### Who It Helps:

**👤 For Buyers:**
- "This property is listed at MK 25M, but similar properties sell for MK 18M-22M"
- Avoid overpaying
- Know if a listing is a good deal or overpriced
- Negotiate better prices

**🏢 For Sellers/Agents:**
- "Price your property at MK 18M-20M for faster sale" (instead of guessing)
- Avoid overpricing (properties sit unsold)
- Avoid underpricing (lose money)
- Price competitively based on market data

**💼 For You (Platform Owner):**
- **Data Product:** Sell price predictions to agents/developers
- **Premium Feature:** "AI Price Estimates" for paid members
- **Valuation Service:** Offer property valuation reports

### Example:
```
Property: 500sqm plot in Lilongwe, Area 47
Listed Price: MK 30M
ML Prediction: MK 22M-26M (85% confidence)
→ Alert: Property may be overpriced by 15%
→ Suggestion: Agent, consider reducing to MK 25M
```

## 🔥 **2. Demand Forecasting Model**
### What It Does:
Predicts which properties will get inquiries (before they're even viewed much)

### Who It Helps:

**👤 For Buyers:**

- Get alerted: "New property matches your budget/location - likely to be popular"

**🏢 For Sellers/Agents:**
- "This property will likely get 15-20 inquiries this month" (optimize listings)
- Understand why some properties get inquiries while others don't
- Improve property descriptions/features to increase demand
- Know when to invest in better photos/promotion

**💼 For You (Platform Owner):**
- **Premium Listings:** "Boost this listing - it's predicted to get high demand"
- **Agent Insights:** "Your property in Area 47 will likely get inquiries if you add more photos"
- **Recommendation Engine:** Show buyers properties they're likely to inquire about

### Example:
```
Property: 3-bedroom house in Blantyre
Current Views: 45
Inquiries: 3
ML Prediction: 85% probability of getting 15+ inquiries in next 30 days
→ High demand forecast - promote this listing
→ Agent: This is a hot property, prepare for inquiries
```
