## ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (ML Services)

### Current Status: **NO ML/AI Services**

**What You Have:**
- ✅ Data collection infrastructure
- ✅ Analytics dashboards
- ✅ Data mining strategy documents

**What You DON'T Have:**
- ❌ No machine learning models
- ❌ No AI-powered recommendations
- ❌ No prediction algorithms
- ❌ No automated insights
- ❌ No ML-based matching

### Why This is Actually GOOD:

1. **Foundation First**: You're collecting the data needed for ML
2. **Clean Data**: Well-structured database ready for ML
3. **No Premature Optimization**: Building ML before having data is wasteful
4. **Cost-Effective**: ML services are expensive - only add when needed

## 🎯 ML Services: When to Add

### Current Stage: **Data Collection Phase** ✅

**You're at the RIGHT stage:**
1. ✅ Collecting comprehensive data
2. ✅ Building analytics infrastructure
3. ✅ Understanding user behavior
4. ✅ Establishing baseline metrics

### When to Add ML (Future):

**Add ML when you have:**
- ✅ 1,000+ properties
- ✅ 10,000+ inquiries
- ✅ 6+ months of data
- ✅ Clear patterns in data

**ML Services to Add (Future):**
1. **Property Recommendations** (when you have enough data)
2. **Price Prediction** (when you have historical sales)
3. **Demand Forecasting** (when you have seasonal patterns)
4. **Buyer Matching** (when you have buyer preferences)

**Cost of ML Services:**
- Simple recommendations: $50-200/month
- Advanced ML: $200-1000/month
- **Not needed yet** - you're collecting data first (smart!)
